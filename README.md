# Tandem proof of concept

This repository accompanies the paper "Tandem: Securing Keys by Using a Central Server While Preserving Privacy" by Wouter Lueks, Brinda Hampiholi, Greg AlpaÃÅr, and Carmela Troncoso, which will be included in PoPETs 2020.3. This repository contains a proof of concept implementation of the timing critical Tandem protocols.

The goal of this repository is to enable reproducing the measurements in the paper.

## Getting started using the Vagrant VM

This repository includes a Vagrant virtual machine that will install and configure all the necessary dependencies. To use it, first install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) using your package manager of choice, and then call (from the root of this repository):

```
vagrant up
```

This will setup an Ubuntu virtual machine, install the required dependencies, and compile RELIC. You can access this machine by calling:

```
vagrant ssh
```

The source files of this repository are in the `/vagrant` directory.

## Installing dependencies by hand (Linux only)

Alternatively, and only on recent Linux machine, you can also try to install the
dependencies by hand. Compare with the `tools/bootstrap-relic.sh` script that is
used to set up the virtual machine on Ubuntu Bionic. First, install the
necessary dependencies:

```
apt-get install build-essential libgmp-dev libsodium-dev libssl-dev cmake
```

Next, checkout and build RELIC. These instructions will install RELIC in `$HOME/local` modify as necessary. The preset will configure RELIC to use the BL12-381 curve which offers 128 bits of security, for a group order of around 255 bits. See [the ZCash blog](https://blog.z.cash/new-snark-curve).

```
git clone https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic.git
cd relic
# Use a version of RELIC which we know works, later versions might work as well
git checkout 13f88f6e6fa3c54b48309baa16cd19c61b4bd850
./preset/x64-pbc-128-b12.sh -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/local/
make
make install
```

To ensure `cmake` can find RELIC set the following environment variables:

```
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/local/lib
export CPATH=$CPATH:$HOME/local/include
export CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/local/lib
```

## Building Tandem code

In the Vagrant virtual machine, this repository is mounted under `/vagrant`. When using your own machine, checkout this repository first. Then run:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
```

## Included libraries

The `extern/` directory contains two included external libraries:

 * The [original libpaillier library](http://acsc.cs.utexas.edu/libpaillier/) implements a relatively unoptimized version of Paillier. The benchmark script shows 26 ms for encrypting and 13 ms for decrypting for 2048 bit keys. In this repository (see `extern/paillier`) we include a [more optimized version](https://github.com/mcornejo/libpaillier) that yields better results: 13ms for encrypting, 3.6 ms for decrypting. It is licensed under GPL 2.0
 
  * An efficient implementation of the Joux-Libert additively homomorphic encryption scheme from the [labhe project](https://github.com/haslab/labhe). See `extern/bhjl`. It is licensed under the MIT license.

# Running experiments

The `bench-tandem` script writes entries to `test.log`. To regenerate the data for the figure, run:

```
for i in `seq 2 2 70`; do ./bench-tandem $i; done
```
